# keithUtils

The goal of keithUtils is to collect various procedures and scripts than make my life easier. First among these are scripts which make it easier to implement consistent folder and file structures amongst working projects. 

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```R
library(keithUtils) ## typically at the start of an rstudio project
setUpProject() ## adds folders I use, and a template projectDescription
newMdaccReport("basicReport") 
## loads a new template report to Reports as follows:
## Reports/r01_basicReport/r01_basicReport.Rmd
## The prefix is autogenerated, helping me keep things
## in workflow order.
```
